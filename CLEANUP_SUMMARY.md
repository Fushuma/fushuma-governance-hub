## Changes Made

### Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md to reference new documentation structure
- Updated QUICKSTART.md to reference DEPLOYMENT.md instead of removed files
- Consolidated all improvements, audits, and roadmap into single PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md

### Content Consolidation
- Merged deployment troubleshooting into main DEPLOYMENT.md
- Merged improvement documentation into PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md
- Removed duplicate governance contract documentation

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: From 29 documentation files to 12 organized files
2. **Clear Structure**: Each document has a specific, non-overlapping purpose
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for each topic
4. **Better Navigation**: Clear hierarchy and cross-references
5. **Up-to-date Content**: Removed obsolete files and outdated information

## Verification

All cross-references have been updated to point to the correct files:
- ✅ README.md documentation links updated
- ✅ QUICKSTART.md references updated
- ✅ No broken internal links

## Next Steps

1. Review the consolidated documentation
2. Merge this branch to main
3. Update any external documentation that references old file names
4. Consider adding a redirect/notice in the repository for users with old bookmarks

**Note:** This cleanup preserves all valuable content while eliminating redundancy. No information was lost; it was consolidated into appropriate documents.

## Implemented Improvements

The following improvements have been successfully implemented based on research from Aragon's governance ecosystem and best practices in DAO governance.

### 1. GitHub Grants Integration

**Location**: `server/services/github-sync.ts`, `server/routers/github.ts`

**Features**:
- Automatic polling of GitHub issues
- Intelligent parsing of grant information from issue templates
- Real-time webhook support for instant updates
- Configurable sync intervals
- Admin panel for manual sync triggers

**Configuration**:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
ENABLE_GITHUB_AUTO_SYNC=true
GITHUB_SYNC_INTERVAL=3600000  # 1 hour in milliseconds
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates manual data entry
- Ensures data consistency between GitHub and the hub
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Provides single source of truth (GitHub issues)

### 2. Enhanced Governance Dashboard

**Location**: `client/src/components/governance/GovernanceDashboard.tsx`

**Description**: Comprehensive dashboard showing user's governance participation and impact.

**Features**:
- Real-time voting power display

### 3. Smart Contract Enhancements (VotingEscrowV2)

**Location**: `governance-contracts/src/VotingEscrowV2.sol`

**Description**: Enhanced version of VotingEscrow with exit fees and minimum lock duration.

**New Features**:

#### Exit Fees
- Configurable exit fee (0-10% in basis points)
- Fees collected to treasury address
- Discourages short-term farming

// Calculate exit fee for amount
uint256 fee = votingEscrow.calculateExitFee(10000 ether);
```

#### Minimum Lock Duration
- Enforced minimum time before exit
- Prevents governance manipulation
- Configurable by governance

```solidity
// Set minimum lock to 2 months
votingEscrow.setMinLockDuration(60 days);

// Check if lock meets minimum
bool meetsMin = votingEscrow.hasMetMinimumLockDuration(tokenId);
```

**Benefits**:
- Stronger tokenomics alignment
